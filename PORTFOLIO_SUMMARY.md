## 🎯 What Makes Your Portfolio Stand Out

### 2. **Terminal Easter Egg** ⭐⭐
Shows personality and technical depth. Recruiters love this.

### 3. **Problem-Solution Format** ⭐⭐
Each project clearly shows: Problem → Approach → Solution → Outcome
(Better than generic descriptions)

(Not "student project" vibes)
